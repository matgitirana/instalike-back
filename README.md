# Instalike back
Instalike-back is a project for storing posts with images attached to them, lightly inspired on Instagram. This was made with the purpose of studying Node.js back-end development.

Developed using `Node.js` and `express`. Integrated with `mongoDB` for database storage and `Google Gemini` for generating descriptions for the images uploaded.

In order to install, simply `npm install` on the root folder.
To run the project, use `npm run dev`.
Note that you must have a `.env` file configured in order to properly connect to the external integrations.
